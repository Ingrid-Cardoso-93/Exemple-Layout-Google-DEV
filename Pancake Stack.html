		<div class="main">A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number.
The values we have seen so far are 1, 2, and “Hello, World!”
These values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and “Hello, World!” is a
string, so called because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter)
can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
The print statement also works for integers. We use the python command to start
the interpreter.</div>
